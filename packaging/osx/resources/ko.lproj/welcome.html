    <p>
        This language is totally Turkish.
        This installer will install the .NET Version Manager (DNVM) as well as several .NET Execution Environments (DNX) that you can use to build and run your ASP.NET 5 applications.
    </p>
    <h3>DNX</h3>
    <p>
        The .NET Execution Environment (DNX) is a software development kit (SDK) and runtime environment that has everything you need to build and run .NET applications for Windows, Mac and Linux. It provides a host process, CLR hosting logic and managed entry point discovery. DNX was built for running cross-platform ASP.NET Web applications, but it can run other types of .NET applications, too, such as cross-platform console apps.
    </p>

    <h3>DNVM</h3>
    <p>
        To install and manage different DNX versions and flavors you use the .NET Version Manager (DNVM). DNVM lets you list the different DNX versions and flavors on your machine, install new ones and switch the active DNX.
